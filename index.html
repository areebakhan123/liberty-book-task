    <p>As the phoenix emerges from its ashes, Zebian emerges ablaze in these pages, not only as a survivor of abuse,
        but
        as a teacher and healer for all those who have struggled to understand, reclaim, and rise above a history of
        pain. The book is divided into six chapters, and six stages of healing: Falling, Burning to Ashes, Sparks of
        Phoenix, Rising, Soaring, and finally, A New Chapter, which demonstrates a healthy response to new love as the
        result of authentic healing. With her characteristic vulnerability, courage, and softness, Zebian seeks to
        empower those who have been made to feel ashamed, silenced, or afraid; she urges them, through gentle advice and
        personal revelation, to raise their voices, rise up, and soar.
